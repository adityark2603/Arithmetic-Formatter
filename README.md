# Arithmetic-Formatter

The arithmetic formatter is typically used to format a list of arithmetic problems, arranging them in a neat, aligned, and readable vertical format. It ensures that each problem in the list is formatted in a consistent way for easy reading, often for educational purposes, coding challenges, or projects that involve basic arithmetic operations.


**Key Features of an Arithmetic Formatter:**
Validations:
Ensures there are no more than five problems.
Verifies that only the + and - operators are used.
Confirms that operands are numeric and no longer than four digits.

Output Formatting:
The problems are formatted with appropriate spacing between the operators, operands, and the results (if requested).
Each problemâ€™s length is determined by the longest operand to ensure alignment.
